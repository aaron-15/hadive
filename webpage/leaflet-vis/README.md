# Hadive Leaflet Visualization

### Setup locally
1. Within the leaflet-vis directory, start a local server, for example:
	```
	http-server &
	````
2. Open your browser of choice and navigate to the corresponding local host (e.g., localhost:8080). You should see the website as intended. 

### Notes
1. `./data/cameras.json` is a reformatted version of `./data/new-data.php`, which was taken directly from dotsignals.org.
2. Image links are set when you click on a marker. If you click on the same marker multiple times you will recieve updated images.

### Future Work
1. Include figures for the daily counts in the popup boxes.
